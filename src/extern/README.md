This directory contains the original source code of the TM-align tool, as
downloaded from the [Zhang group web
page](https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/TMalign.cpp). It also contains a modified
version, `TMalign-modified.cpp`, with some fixes to allow the tool to be built
on Windows and macOS.

The original tool from the Zhang lab was originally released under the MIT
license. The modifications for Windows/macOS builds are also released under the
MIT license.
